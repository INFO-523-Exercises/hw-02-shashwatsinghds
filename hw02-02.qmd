# Exploring like a Data Adventurer

# Required Setup

```{r}
# Sets the number of significant figures to two - e.g., 0.01
options(digits = 2)

# Required package for quick package downloading and loading 
if (!require(pacman))
  install.packages("pacman")

# Downloads and load required packages
pacman::p_load(dlookr, # Exploratory data analysis
               formattable, # HTML tables from R outputs
               here, # Standardizes paths to data
               kableExtra, # Alternative to formattable
               knitr, # Needed to write HTML reports
               missRanger, # To generate NAs
               tidyverse) # Powerful data wrangling package suite
```

# Load and Examine a Data Set

Using the dataset from tidyurl- The dataset contains stock prices of big tech companies and tries to analyse the collapse of "Big Tech" stock prices. The data comes from Yahoo Finance via Kaggle

```{r}
# Loading the dataset
dataset <- read.csv("/Users/shashwatsingh/Documents/GitHub/hw-02-shashwatsinghds/data/big_tech_stock_prices.csv") 

# Formattable data
dataset |>
  head() |>
  formattable()
```

# Diagnose your Data

```{r}
#Properties of the data
dataset |>
  diagnose() |>
  formattable()
```

-   `variables`: name of each variable

-   `types`: data type of each variable

-   `missing_count`: number of missing values

-   `missing_percent`: percentage of missing values

-   `unique_count`: number of unique values

-   `unique_rate`: rate of unique value - unique_count / number of observations

## Box Plot

## Skewness

![](/Users/shashwatsingh/Documents/GitHub/hw-02-shashwatsinghds/Images/skew_intro-dark.png)

#### **NOTE**

-   "Skewness" has multiple definitions. Several underlying equations mey be at play

-   Skewness is "designed" for distributions with one peak (*unimodal*); it's meaningless for distributions with multiple peaks (*multimodal*).

-   Most default skewness definitions are not robust: a single outlier could completely distort the skewness value.

-   We can't make conclusions about the locations of the mean and the median based on the skewness sign.

## Kurtosis

![](/Users/shashwatsingh/Documents/GitHub/hw-02-shashwatsinghds/Images/kurt_intro-dark.png)

#### **NOTE**

-   There are multiple definitions of kurtosis - i.e., "kurtosis" and "excess kurtosis," but there are other definitions of this measure.

-   Kurtosis may work fine for distributions with one peak (*unimodal*); it's meaningless for distributions with multiple peaks (*multimodal*).

-   The classic definition of kurtosis is not robust: it could be easily spoiled by extreme outliers.

# Describe your Continuous Data

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Summary statistics 
dataset |>
  describe() 
```

-   `describes_variables`: name of the column being described

-   `n`: number of observations excluding missing values

-   `na`: number of missing values

-   `mean`: arithmetic average

-   `sd`: standard deviation

-   `se_mean`: standard error mean. sd/sqrt(n)

-   `IQR`: interquartile range (Q3-Q1)

-   `skewness`: skewness

-   `kurtosis`: kurtosis

-   `p25`: Q1. 25% percentile

-   `p50`: median. 50% percentile

-   `p75`: Q3. 75% percentile

-   `p01`, `p05`, `p10`, `p20`, `p30`: 1%, 5%, 20%, 30% percentiles

-   `p40`, `p60`, `p70`, `p80`: 40%, 60%, 70%, 80% percentiles

-   `p90`, `p95`, `p99`, `p100`: 90%, 95%, 99%, 100% percentiles

# Describe your Continuous Data: Refined

The above is pretty overwhelming, and most people don't care about percentiles outside of Q1, Q3, and the median (Q2).

```{r, warning=FALSE, error= FALSE}
# Summary statistics, selecting the desired ones
dataset |>
  describe()|>
  select(described_variables, n, na, mean, sd, se_mean, IQR, skewness, kurtosis, p25, p50, p75) 


```

# Describe Categorical Variables

```{r}
dataset |>
  diagnose_category() |>
  formattable()
```

-   `variables`: category names

-   `levels`: group names within categories

-   `N`: number of observation

-   `freq`: number of observation at group level / number of observation at category level

-   `ratio`: percentage of observation at group level / number of observation at category level

-   `rank`: rank of the occupancy ratio of levels (order in which the groups are in the category)

## Group Descriptive Statistics

```{r, error=FALSE}
dataset |>
  group_by(stock_symbol) |>
  describe() |>
  select(described_variables, stock_symbol, n, na, mean, sd, se_mean, IQR, skewness, kurtosis, p25, p50, p75) |>
  formattable()
```

# Testing Normality

-   Shapiro-Wilk test & Q-Q plots

-   Testing overall normality of two columns

-   Testing normality of groups

## Normality of Columns

#### Shapiro-Wilk Test

Shapiro-Wilk test looks at whether a target distribution is sample form a normal distribution

```{r}
# Diagnose our categorical columns
dataset |>
  normality() |>
  formattable()
```

#### Q-Q Plots

Plots of the quartiles of a target data set and plot it against predicted quartiles from a normal distribution

```{r}
dataset |>
plot_normality()

```

### **Normality within Groups**

Looking within stock_symbol at the subgroup normality

#### Shapiro-Wilk Test

```{r}
dataset |>
  group_by(stock_symbol) |>
  select(high, low, stock_symbol) |>
  normality() |>
  formattable()
```

#### Q-Q Plots

```{r}
dataset |>
group_by(stock_symbol) |>
  select(high, low, stock_symbol) |>
  plot_normality()
```

## **Produce an HTML Normality Summary**

```{r}
#eda_web_report(dataset)
```
